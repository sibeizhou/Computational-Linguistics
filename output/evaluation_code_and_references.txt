We don't have a evaluation code or something else for this program. Because we do the evaluation when doing the classify in each case we get a model and optimize it at different epoch time. So the accurancy is already output to the screen and that is what we take as evaluation for the model.

The screen output is from project.py and we write it into output.txt.
